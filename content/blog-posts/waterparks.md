My fiancee and I saw Waterparks at The Fillmore Silver Spring the other night and they put on such a good show that they've officially become **her favorite band**. It was never going to be easy dethroning Good Charlotte in that position, but these three fools did it in a single night. If that isn't getting the point across about how good they are, then I don't know what will. This blog post may as well not exist if those words carried no weight.

Jokes (mostly) aside, Waterparks have grown on me over the years. I was introduced to them nearly four years ago by that same fiancee I mentioned earlier, but I wasn't feeling their music then. I don't know what it was, but something didn't stick. They only had one LP at that time and a few of the tracks were solid, but nothing blew me away.

Fast forward a handful of years and they put out their latest LP _Greatest Hits_. This album is a must-listen if for no reason other than it being an auditory experience of a band pushing the limits of how many sounds can be layered on top of one another before it stops sounding good.

Waterparks experiments with styles I'm not used to hearing on a rock album nowadays. You may expect a new rock album to be dumbed down or middle of the road, but I get the impression that these guys stopped caring what anyone could think with the release of _Greatest Hits_. Some bands give that shpeel like "this is the album we were meant to make" or "we went into this album with the sole purpose of making the album we wanted to hear" and, well, sometimes that's a load of bullshit. How can you tell me it took you four albums to _finally_ make the album you wanted to make, insert band name here? On the contrary, Waterparks does actually come out with an album that rings true to those statements (I haven't checked to see if they've made those claims here).

If there's only one song to take away from here, I'll say it's _Numb_ (music video below) because it is a catchy-yet-powerful track with an ending that explodes into layers you didn't see coming. My only complaint is that they don't toy with that outro for longer.
