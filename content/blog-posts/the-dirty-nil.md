You know that feeling of a cool, summer breeze after a long day of suffering through the existence that is life? Well, imagine that except with a sudden urge to punch a wall out of sheer enjoyment. That is roughly what it feels like to listen through _Fuck Art_ - the latest album from [The Dirty Nil](https://thedirtynil.com/).

It's hard to describe how this album makes you feel simultaneously like you just got let out of school at the start of summer vacation, but that you also need a beer right then and there.

It actually took me a while to appreciate what these guys were doing. I first heard about them (I think) from their [session on Audiotree](https://audiotree.tv/session/the-dirty-nil/). I was immediately hooked and dove into that first album, but it was a short-lived romance likely as a result of the tumultuous time that is _college_. But when I heard "Done With Drugs" as a single for _Fuck Art_, I revisited the catalogue and saw what my life had been missing this whole time.

Just give that a listen and tell me I'm wrong. And when you're done with that, [dive into the full album](https://go.thedirtynil.com/FArt) because it's worth every repeated listen.
