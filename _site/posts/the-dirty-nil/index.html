<p>You know that feeling of a cool, summer breeze after a long day of suffering through the existence that is life? Well, imagine that except with a sudden urge to punch a wall out of sheer enjoyment.</p>
<p>That is roughly what it feels like to listen through <em>Fuck Art</em> - the latest album from <a href="https://thedirtynil.com/">The Dirty Nil</a>.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe how this album makes you feel simultaneously like you just got let out of school at the start of summer vacation, but that you also need a beer right then and there.</p>
<p>It actually took me a while to appreciate what these guys were doing. I first heard about them (I think) from their <a href="https://audiotree.tv/session/the-dirty-nil/">session on Audiotree</a>. I was immediately hooked and dove into that first album, but it was a short-lived romance likely as a result of the tumultuous time that is <em>college</em>. But when I heard &quot;Done With Drugs&quot; as a single for <em>Fuck Art</em>, I revisited the catalogue and saw what my life had been missing this whole time.</p>

<p>Just give that a listen and tell me I'm wrong. And when you're done with that, <a href="https://go.thedirtynil.com/FArt">dive into the full album</a> because it's worth every repeated listen.</p>
