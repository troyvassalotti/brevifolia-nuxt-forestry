<p>I had a hard time preparing for this article. No, not because it was emotionally draining or anything, but because how do you write about a band that barely exists on the internet?</p>
<p>When Lower Lands put out their EP <em>Growing Pains</em> in 2012, I was all in. I can't remember if the <em>Reality in Routine</em> music video was my first introduction to them, but it's what I still go back to these days. You know why? Because YouTube is the only place you can listen to them.</p>
<p><strong>I'm serious.</strong></p>
<p>I'm actually a little impressed by how much they were able to remove of themselves online because that is not an easy feat these days.</p>
<p>Your favorite (and least favorite) streaming services don't know they exist. At one point in time, I purchased their EPs on Bandcamp, but even Bandcamp doesn't believe that happened. My only evidence that Lower Lands was an actual band that made actual music is a defunct Facebook page, some music videos, and my personal music collection.</p>
<p>But don't just take my word for it; here's that music video I talked about:</p>

<p>It's become a complicated hassle to listen to music <em>not on</em> a subscription streaming service. Like I said, I have a handful of their EPs and my only option is to play them directly from local storage, but even that involves either syncing my music library across devices (<em>way too many gigs to do that</em>) or purposefully loading these tracks on my phone, laptop, etc.</p>
<p>Have I done those things? You bet I have. I've done those things at various points in time <em>solely</em> to listen to <em>Growing Pains</em>.</p>
<p>A couple of the guys went on to start <a href="https://fizzyblood.bandcamp.com/">other bands</a>, and that's cool. I like to see that they didn't give up entirely. Hell, maybe I'm stirring up some shit right now and the reality is that these guys <strong>hated</strong> each other so much that they tried to scrub their existence off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>I don't know about that, but I do know that Lower Lands was a sick band that ended too soon.</p>
