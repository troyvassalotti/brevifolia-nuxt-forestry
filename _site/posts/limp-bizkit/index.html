<p>I don't know exactly what compelled me to make this decision, but I started July off with the intent to listen through Limp Bizkit's entire discography.</p>
<p>All I knew about LB were a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They wrote &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;Rollin'&quot;</li>
<li>Fred Durst (and the band itself) is the butt of a lot of jokes</li>
<li>Wes Borland is a cool guitarist</li>
</ul>
<p>I must've been in a serious musical lull to be okay with exposing myself to 24/7 Limp Bizkit, but the journey has changed my outlook on the band - and my listening habits - for the better.</p>
<h2>The Journey</h2>
<p><em>Significant Other</em> was the starting point for this deep dive because I was most familiar with its track list, but don't worry, I did start from the beginning with <em>Three Dollar Bill, Yall</em> afterwards. I'll be honest that I went into this expecting a good laugh and to soon abandon the plan, but <strong>I could not have been more wrong.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Just Like This&quot; hooked me in from the get-go and the hits kept rollin' and rollin' from there. The blend of guitars and drums is so tight and full of groove - a trait that will follow the band through their history. The album isn't a non-stop hit show, falling off during the second half into a forgettable set of tracks, but it doesn't diminish the absolute blast I had.</p>
<p>I took a step back to the start of it all, <em>Three Dollar Bill, Yall</em> and experienced an (expectedly) less exciting album, but it isn't without its pros. Overall, the songs feel samey, but I can't knock a band's debut LP too much. &quot;Stuck&quot; and &quot;Pollution&quot; are jams and I can't deny that. It's actually impressive seeing how they managed to reign in their sound to create <em>Significant Other</em> after this release.</p>
<p>By this point, I'm upset I deprived myself of Limp Bizkit for all these years, yet self-aware enough to know I would not have appreciated it as much as I do now. Borland's tone and style is one to envy. Oh, and Otto's drumming alone is enough to have me considering the possibilities of fitting a kit in my Baltimore row home basement.</p>

<p>As I'm writing this post, &quot;Break Stuff&quot; started playing and I'm feeling pumped as hell.</p>
<p>Up next, of course, was <em>Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water</em>. I had mixed feelings on this one, initially not enjoying it much. I gave it another listen the other day and realized I missed a few good tunes on this one, but still nothing that blew my mind aside from the select songs in my resulting playlist. &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin'&quot; are solid tracks and I'll be mastering my ability to play &quot;Rollin'&quot; soon.</p>
<p><em>Results May Vary</em> turned out to be a nice surprise for me. The lack of Borland does not go unnoticed, but the alternative is a cool change of pace for the band. I know it isn't a well-received album, but that follows the pattern of me liking under-appreciated albums and tracks. &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; has strong, beefy chords while &quot;Phenomenon&quot; goes hard in the chorus with the usual guitar-drum combo. I can see myself revisiting this album more than the average listener.</p>
<p>From <em>Reuslts May Vary</em>, <em>Gold Cobra</em> took eight more years to be released, but I only had to wait a few hours before I could enjoy it. You know, because I doing this in 2022. My first listen felt a lot like it did with <em>Chocolate Starfish</em>, but subsequent listens have led me to appreciate it even more. &quot;Shark Attack&quot;, &quot;Bring It Back&quot;, and &quot;Why Try&quot; are all straight wild.</p>
<p>Another <strong>10 years</strong> and <em>Still Sucks</em> hit the shelves (physical and digital). The opening three tracks are exactly what I want out of Limp Bizkit: powerful beats, heavy guitars, and a flow you can move to. Not my favorite album, but &quot;Out of Style&quot; and &quot;Dirty Rotten Bizkit&quot; are easily top-tier Bizkit songs.</p>
<h2>The Summary</h2>
<p>I am unabashedly a Limp Bizkit fan and sad I became one just in time to miss their Baltimore show in May. Technically, I was out of the country at that time, but my point still stands.</p>
