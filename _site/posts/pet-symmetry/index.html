<p>Discovering a new band or genre has often led to defining moments in my life.</p>
<p>There was the time in high school when I learned what post-rock was, or when I stumbled upon Aesop Rock's <em>The Impossible Kid</em>, or even my first time in the pit of a Four Year Strong show. (They're probably the only band where I'll actively seek a spot in the pit.)</p>
<p>But we're not talking about any of those moments right now. Sometime in college - likely after a breakup - I gave Into It. Over It.'s <em>Proper</em> a listen. That album took me on a journey of musical discovery like no other, which is why we're talking about Pet Symmetry today.</p>
<p>Pet Symmetry is the trio of Erik Czaja, Marcus Nuccio, and Evan Thomas Weiss, and they recently (to this blog post) released their third LP <em>Future Suits</em>. If I told you this album gets better with each and every listen, I'd still be underselling how great it is. The previous release, <em>Visions</em>, is an equally enjoyable album, but there is something I can't quite put my finger on about <em>Future Suits</em>.</p>
<p>The production is top-notch; the hooks are clean as hell (who decided hell was a clean place?); and they cover such a wide range of sounds. If you're able to get through the music video for &quot;2021: A Personal Space Odyssey&quot; without feeling the most pumped you've ever been, then I commend you.</p>

<p>Listening to Pet Symmetry has influenced my own writing by showing me a way to be lighthearted-yet-sincere in my music - both instrumentally and lyrically. I'm by no means a lyric writer, but I've moved on from that notion that I have to be <em>going through something</em> to write a song; a song could be about what's going on <em>at this moment</em> and not be a depressing diary entry.</p>

<p>I saw the band in DC on the <em>Visions</em> tour, and if they end up coming around here again for <em>Future Suits</em> then you bet I'll be there. Their stage chemistry is something to admire and I'll still name them as one of my favorite live acts because of it.</p>
<p>If you like what you heard in the music video above, then do check out the whole album. My personal favorite track is <em>Pet Sympathy</em> and it's (almost) all due to that killer lead in the chorus; I get an instant smile guaranteed when it hits.</p>
