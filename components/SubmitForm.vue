		<h3>Want to submit a band?</h3>
		<p>
			Use this form to submit a band to the site. You don't have to give me a name or email, but by
			not doing so I won't be able to attribute the post to you nor would I be able to contact you
			if there's something weird about your submission.
		</p>
		<p>
			Include as much information as you'd like in the submission box. Write your story, include a
			link to a video or song, etc. Please don't write a novel.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you like working in GitHub and hate this form, you can also request or submit a band by
			<a href="https://github.com/troyvassalotti/thisisaband-site/issues">filing an issue</a>.
		</p>
